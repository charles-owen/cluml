<p><u>What is an Association?</u></p>
<p> Associations are a link that represent how two classes communicate with each other.</p>
<p><u>Components of an Association</u></p>
<p><b>Association Role:</b> The Association Role clarifies the kind of communication occuring between
    the two classes. Associations can have up to two roles, one for each connected class. Say we have
    two classes that are connected with an Association; "Dog" and "Human". The Association Role from
    Human to Dog would be "Pet" and the Role from Dog to Human would be "Lick"</p>
<p><b>Class Multiplicity:</b> Association Multiplicity indicates the number of instances of a class
    that this communication is expected to involve. Like Association Roles, there is a multiplicity
    for each connected class. In the "Human" and "Dog" example, Humans can pet any number of Dogs and
    Dogs can Lick any number of Humans. This would make the Multiplicity of both ends of the communication
    '0..*'.</p>
<p><u>How to Edit Associations in clUML</u></p>
<p><b>Creating Associations</b> To create an Association, first enter 'Association Mode' by clicking
    on an association from the Palette. While in Association Mode, Clicking and Dragging from a
    Class will create an Association that follows the cursor instead of moving the Class. Drag the Association
    to another Class and release it to connect the Association.</p>
<p><b>Interacting with Association Mode</b> To enter Association Mode, you must click on an Association
    from the Palette. Association Mode can be exited in several ways; by pressing escape, clicking on the
    selected Association in the Palette, or by clicking on a Class component in the Palette.</p>
<p><b>Entering Roles / Multiplicities:</b> To Edit a role or multiplicity of an End Node, either
    right-click on the end node you want to edit and select Edit Multiplicty/Label, or double-click
    on the multiplicity or role to edit it.</p>
<p><b>Creating a Node:</b> An additional Node can be created in an association by left-clicking
anywhere there isn't a node; A node will be automatically created that follows the cursor.</p>
<p><b>Deleting a Node:</b> Nodes can be deleted by dragging them towards either of the terminal
    nodes, or by right-clicking on them and selecting 'Delete Node'</p>
<p><b>Deleting an Association:</b> Associations can be deleted by right-clicking on the end node
    and selecting 'Delete Association', or by disconecting the association from one of the classes
    it is connected to.</p>
