<p><u>What is Aggregation?</u></p>
<p> Aggregation models a class relationship where one class owns encompases another but both classes
    can exist independently of one another. For example, if we had the class Sentence and Paragraph,
    a paragraph "owns" several sentence, but a sentence can exist independently of a paragraph. </p>
