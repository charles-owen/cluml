<p><u>What is Inheritance?</u></p>
<p> Inheritance models a parent-child relationship between two classes, where the child class Inherits
all the operations and attributes of the Parent. For example, if we had a Mammal Class and a Dog class,
there should be an Inheritance relationship between the Dog and Mammal class.</p>
