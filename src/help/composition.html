<p><u>What is Composition?</u></p>
<p> Composition models a class relationship, where one class fully encompases another; without the existence
    of the composing element the other element wouldn't exist. For example, if we had the class Dog and
    the class Tail, a Tail can't exist without a dog, so that would be Composition. </p>
