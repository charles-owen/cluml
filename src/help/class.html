<p><u>What is a Class?</u></p>
<p>Classes are the main component of UML class diagrams. Class components are representations
    of objects or groups of objects that share a common structure and behavior.</p>
<p><u>Components of a Class</u></p>
<p><b>Class Name:</b> The Class Name is what the class is referred to as. It should be representative
    of what the class object is representing in the program that the UML diagram is modeled off of.
    For example, if a class is named "Dog", then it most likely represents dog objects.</p>
<p><b>Class Attributes:</b> The Class Attributes are the variables of a class. These attributes
    typically describe information about the class. For example, if we consider the Dog class, it
    may have attributes like "name: String" and "color: String" which describes the name and fur color
    of the dog. These attributes would be defined upon the creation of a Dog object, such as if a user
    creates a new Dog object with "name = 'Bluey'" and "color = 'blue'", which creates a blue Dog object
    named Bluey.</p>
<p><b>Class Operations:</b> The Class Operations are the methods of a class. The operations typically
    describe what the class is able to do. For example, if we once again consider the Dog class, it
    could have operations like "fetch(): TennisBall" which is a method that describes the Dog object
    going to get a tennis ball and the function ends with a return call that returns the TennisBall
    object. These operations would be defined within the class itself and will be a common behavior
    among all objects of this class.</p>
<p><u>How to Edit a Class in clUML</u></p>
<p><b>Adding New Attributes / Operations:</b> If you would like to add a new attribute to the class,
    right-click on the class (long touch on a touch screen) to bring up the class' context menu. Then,
    click on the first option, which says "Add". This will add a new default attribute to the class.
    You can also add a new attribute to the class by using the keyboard shortcut "Ctrl + A" while the
    class is selected. The class will automatically resize itself to add space for the new attribute.
    If you'd like to add a new operation to the class, add a new attribute to the
    class and edit the attribute so that it includes parentheses (()) before the colon (:), and the
    class will automatically detect and change the attribute to an operation.</p>
<p><b>Editing Existing Class Name / Attributes / Operations:</b> If you would like to edit an existing
    class name / attribute / operation, you can double-click on the component of the class that you'd
    like to change to put the component into editing mode. Once you are in editing mode, you can
    type in your changes and confirm them by either pressing the Enter key or by deselecting
    the component you are editing by clicking off of it.</p>
<p><b>Deleting Attributes / Operations:</b> If you would like to delete an attribute / operation, simply
    double-click on the attribute / operation you would like to delete to put it into editing mode,
    then delete the text from that attribute / operation so that you are left with an empty input. If
    you confirm changes with an empty input by either pressing the Enter key or by deselecting the
    attribute / operation by clicking off it, it will delete that attribute / operation from the class.
    The class will automatically resize itself to remove the space for the missing
    attribute / operation.</p>
<p><b>Deleting a Class:</b> If you would like to delete a class, you can right-click (long touch on
    a touch screen) on the class you want to delete. This will bring up the class' context menu, where
    you can then click on the third option that says "Delete". This will delete the class from the
    UML class diagram.</p>
